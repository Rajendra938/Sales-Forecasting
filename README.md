# Welcome

This project demonstrates food-demand forecasting into an interactive [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io) app.

The first module uses the metadata of the store and gives forecasting on the next week's sales.

The second module is a more generic forecasting, you can forecast sales based on the Past week's sales.

Note - The first module is more accurate than the second module, as the first module also considers the product data.
